					<div id="mw-content-text" lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr"><div class="intro">This tutorial describes a known working method of creating a multiple sound track overdubbing session from scratch in Audacity. That is, you record one track and then play it back and add a second track against it: drums, guitar, voice; repeat as needed. 
This process uses a particular USB microphone that has bi-directional headphone monitoring and management built into its base.In this tutorial you will be able to hear a mix of your live recording and the previous tracks simultaneously in your headphones (also required). Live monitoring is often unavailable (or you hear yourself too late) without purpose-built hardware.</div>

<p>The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.samsontech.com/samson/products/microphones/usb-microphones/gtrack/">Samson® G-Track</a> is a good quality, large capsule, condenser USB microphone; it has a headphone connection in its base in addition to the USB connection. <br />
</p>
<dl><dd><span title="Samson G-Track microphone"><img alt="SureGTrack.png" src="../m/images/5/54/suregtrack.png" width="327" height="671" /></span></dd></dl>
<p>The microphone has other tricks, but this tutorial will stick with a live acoustical performance. Leave the <b>INST</b> knob all the way down and pushed in.
</p><p>Switch to <b>INST/MIC</b> and <b>MONO</b> and the microphone will mix sound from the computer playback with live performance sound. This is the mix you need to sing or play to yourself with no latency, echoes or other impairment.
</p><p>Almost any Windows®, Mac® or Linux® machine with fast enough USB and good storage can be used.
</p><p>Our example here uses Mac earbuds for listening, but nearly any good headphones or earbuds are OK.
</p>
<dl><dd><span title="Mac earbuds"><img alt="MAC earBuds.jpg" src="../m/images/6/6d/mac_earbuds.jpg" width="332" height="174" /></span></dd></dl>
<p>If you require cranium-crushing headphone volume, you may need a headphone amplifier. You must get the headphone sound from the Samson G-Track, <i><b>not</b></i> from the computer soundcard. 
</p><p>Headphone monitoring is good; live microphones and speakers in the same room is a recipe for feedback.<br />
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Samson_G-Track_has_three_jobs:">The Samson G-Track has three jobs:</span></h3>
<ol><li>It converts your voice or performance to digital and sends it down the USB cable for recording. </li>
<li>It converts the USB digital audio from the computer back to analog. </li>
<li>It has an internal headphone mixer. The G-Track can mix your existing track playback and your new, live performance so you can listen to both.</li></ol>
<p>The one "magic" feature of this  device is the ability to mix your live voice with the computer's rhythm track so you can hear the mixed musical performance and that can only happen if the rhythm track is available. Making the USB device the playback device makes this functionality available.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="First_Recording">First Recording</span></h2>
<p>First we will make a simple recording, with no overdubbing or other fancy tricks. The system has to work correctly for simple recording and playback before we go further.
</p><p>Connect the USB and headphones.

<p>The microphone must have a short, direct USB connection to the computer; USB audio will not go through a hub nor long USB extension cables.

<div class="note">You may want to make the Audacity project window larger than its default and expand the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/meter_toolbar.html">Meter Toolbar</a>.</div>
<p><br />
Click once anywhere inside the recording meter (the one with the mic icon) to put the meters into Monitor Mode. They will display the microphone's sound level without sending Audacity into full record and wasting drive space. This may fail on certain <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Linux_Issues#JACK">Linux machines using Jack</a>.
</p><p>Switch the Samson G-Track to <b>INST/MIC</b> and <b>MONO</b>. The G-Track produces a half and half mix of computer playback and live performance. Set the <b>VOLUME</b> knob for comfortable listening. 
</p><p>Play or sing into the microphone. Adjust Audacity's recording control so you don't peak much over -10 to -6 on Audacity's meters. You can fix low levels later, but you cannot fix overloading, smashing, and clipping (meters too far to the right). 
</p><p>Click "<b>Record</b>"; Audacity will take a second to configure itself and start recording. The blue waves will start to crawl left to right as you perform. Play or sing a simple song that you can use for rhythm and timing tests later.
</p><p>Click "<b>Stop</b>", then "<b>Home</b>" and then click "<b>Play</b>" to hear the track you have just made. You should hear the track in your headphones. This is all you will hear during the overdub sessions. You will only hear your voice or instrument in your headphones <b>after</b> you record it.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Setting_the_Recording_Latency">Setting the Recording Latency</span></h2>
<p>Click "<b>Home</b>" then click "<b>Record</b>" and you will get a new recording underneath the first one. Sing or perform in time to the first track; when finished click on "<b>Stop</b>" then "<b>Home</b>".
</p><p>The project will have two tracks, one from each performance, but it may be seriously out of time or rhythm -- even though you were in perfect time when you recorded it. This is <b>recording latency</b> and you can adjust it to zero using Audacity's latency tools; done properly, both the live recording session and the later playback will be in perfect time.

<dd>That's how much the rhythm misses and that's the latency. Keep magnifying until you can get a good shot at accuracy. <span class="kbrd" style="background-color: #d0d0f8">CTRL+3</span> - or on Mac <span class="kbrd" style="background-color: #d0d0f8">CMD+3</span> to back out slightly if you magnify too much by accident.</dd></dl>
<ul><li>At the bottom of the Audacity window in the Selection Toolbar set the middle time control to "<b>Length</b>" (one of the two radio buttons) then change the format using the dropdown menu to:</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>hh:mm:ss: + milliseconds<br /></dd></dl></dd>
<dd>You're mostly interested in the milliseconds -- the last numbers on the right. The reading in the example above is 209 msec.</dd></dl>
<ul><li>Audacity <span class="menu">Preferences &gt; Recording...</span> set Latency Correction to  the negative of the number in the Length dispaly - in this case -209 milliseconds - then click "<b>OK</b>".</li></ul>
<ul><li>Go through the whole process again.</li></ul>
<dl><dd>This time the two click tracks should look perfectly on (or very close to it) and sound perfectly in time. If not, zoom in, measure the new difference and add that number to the latency value.</dd>
<dd><span title="Audacity Project with no latency - Mac OS X screen shot"><img alt="NoLatencyMonoMac 206 SnapTo.png" src="../m/images/b/bf/nolatencymonomac_206_snapto.png" width="725" height="434" /></span></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>In this example, the tracks align to within 23 <i>samples</i>, which is about 0.5 milliseconds - less than the smallest correction you can make in the Latency Correction. This is as good as it gets.</dd></dl>

<div class="note">Before you get too obsessive about this, an orchestral musician once said that the chances of any two instruments in the orchestra starting the same note at the same time is zero, so you don't need to adjust things down to the digital sample level.

<p><span class="menu">File &gt; Close</span> (you don't need to save any of your tests). You're ready for the first recording session.
</p><p>Switch the Samson G-Track to <b>INST/MIC</b> and <b>MONO</b>, as it was for the first recording.  Set the <b>volume</b> knob for comfortable listening. 
</p><p>Turn the G-Track MIC back to where it was for the first recording and switch to MONO.
</p><p>The first recording can be whatever you're planning to use as a base, backing track, guide or rhythm track. It can be anything including <span class="menu">Generate &gt; Rhythm Track</span> or a rhythm and chord machine playing to the mixer.
</p><p>You should record a lead-in. That is, a non-musical rhythmical clue before the music starts so as to warn you of the imminent start. In a live band, this would be the drummer or lead guitar count-in. You could use the keyboard rhythm stops or you can perform several rim shots into the microphone to establish the rhythm before the first note; tapping on the table with a pencil also works.  You can sheer it off later in post production so nobody else will hear it. Tick, tick, tick, tick, music; adjust as appropriate for music type and rhythm.
</p><p>Click "<b>Stop</b>", then "<b>Home</b>" and then "<b>Shift + Record</b>" to record track two using your live performance and track playback in your headphone mix as a guide. Repeat for as many tracks as required.
</p><p>The <span class="button">Mute</span> and <span class="button">Solo</span> buttons to the left of each track are valuable in overdubbing. Solo causes only that track to play and Mute turns that track off. Solo has options that can be set in <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/tracks_preferences.html">Preferences</a>. The gain control in the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/audio_tracks.html#panel">Track Control Panel</a> to the left of each waveform controls the playback volume of that track -- it affects the headphone mix.
</p><p>When you get to a stopping point click the <b>Stop</b> button <img alt="Play button" src="../m/images/f/f9/stop.png" title="Play button" width="16" height="16" /> then choose <span class="menu">File &gt; Save Project &gt; <a href="file_menu_save_project.html#save_project" title="File Menu: Save Project">Save Project</a></span> to save your project. 
</p><p>As you progress, you should save a new Project periodically with a slightly different file name using <span class="menu">File &gt; Save Project &gt; <a href="file_menu_save_project.html#save_lossless_copy_of_project" title="File Menu: Save Project">Save Lossless Copy of Project...</a></span>. A good recommendation is to use ISO date and time for the file names or the start of the file names; refrain from using slash marks or other punctuation marks in a file name.
</p>
<div class="note"><b>ISO Date and time</b>

Do not go weeks with one Project and file name, and never cover up or record over existing work. If anything happened to that one Project, your project would be ruined and could nullify weeks of work. Think of what would happen if the lights went out right now, the computer ground to a halt and you were forced to use the last known good version of the project. 
</p><p>For extra safety it is good practice to periodically back up your project versions to a DVD-R or external hard drive for archive purposes. Remember that it is important to keep the AUP file and the _data folder together. One way to make sure of this is to create a zip archive of the AUP file and _data folder. In the unlikely event that the Audacity project is corrupted or your hard drive crashes you will be able to recover your work. 
</p><p>Note that Audacity projects cannot be played in computer media players nor burned to audio CDs. Export your project as 16-bit WAV or AIF for burning to a CD, or to MP3 for email or internet delivery. See <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/mixing.html">Mixing Audio Tracks</a>, in the Audacity Manual, for advice on doing the final mix of your project.
